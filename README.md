# AutoValuator

**This project involves developing a machine learning model to accurately estimate the prices of used cars based on key features like brand, model year, mileage, and fuel type.

**Project Overview**
In this project, I built a Linear Regression model to predict the price of used cars. The model was trained on a dataset with key car attributes, and achieved a 92% R² accuracy, providing reliable predictions of car prices.

**Key Features:**
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features to improve model performance.

**Model Implementation:**
Built and trained a Linear Regression model, optimizing train-test splits for better accuracy and reliability.

**Model Accuracy**: Achieved an R² score of 92%, demonstrating strong predictive power for used car prices.
**Steps:**
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Model training with optimized data splits.
Model evaluation using metrics like R².
